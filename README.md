Peruvian Ministry of Health cost-effectiveness analysis of the Sabes program to identify acute HIV infections in Lima.

***

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the Sabes program compared 
to the standard of care from the perspective of the Peruvian Ministry of Health. We evaluate 
the cost of a testing program that incorporates the Sabes strategy, the effectiveness of the program 
by estimating the proportion of cases of HIV detected during the acute/recent phase of infection, 
and the proportion of individuals with new HIV diagnoses successfully linked to care through the 
peer navigation program. This project is aiding Peruvian policy makers in assessing the economic 
impact of implementing the Sabes approach of frequent HIV testing and rapid linkage to HIV care 
through peer navigators. It provides evidence for decision makers at the Peruvian Ministry of Health 
who are considering whether or not to adopt this strategy.
